### Description
This is a simple version of the Rails Record Store project built from the Epicodus curriculum through the end of the "Rails with Active Record" course section. It is intended to serve as a template that students can use when working with the "Authentication and Authorization" section. Note that this is a VERY bare-bones example. It does not include essential parts of a Rails app such as Model validations, flash messages or testing.
